I am a senior, majoring in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I am an engineer for the hardware team. My job is to design and manufacture the manipulator system, especially the Gripper. I make 3D models of the system using AutoCAD, Solidworks and Autodesk Inventor. I have great passion for Manufacturing. I have had three technical internships, related to manufacturing, over my undergraduate course. I plan to graduate in Fall 2020, and work with my family thereafter.
