** Andrew Hossack - President ** 
</center>

Hi Everyone! My name is Andrew Hossack, but some of you might know me as the "UAV Guy" on campus. I am the president of UAV IARC Team, and Secretary of Aerospace for the 20'-21' year. Currently a Junior working towards my B.S. in Computer Engineering, I have a passion in aerospace, IoT, and most things up in space or in the air. Currently I am employed as an E.E. intern at Honeybee Robotics - an awesome company who designs space mechanical and electrical systems! One word of advice is that you can do whatever you put your mind to, you just need to work hard and listen! Shoot for the stars!

** Pradhyun Kashyap - Remote Pilot and Support **
</center>

Unmanned aircraft systems, or drones are no longer toys or hobby, these are now a tool for entry into dozens of lucrative careers. As a Certified Remote Pilot, my job is to manage unmanned aerial vehicle flight operations and make sure to practice all the procedures and policies from Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to include standard flight and ground operations. Also, my primary tasks include building flight vehicle structure and related components as a support assistance to the hardware team.
