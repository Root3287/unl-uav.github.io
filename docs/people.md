Unmanned aircraft systems, or drones are no longer toys or hobby, these are now a tool for entry into dozens of lucrative careers. As a Certified Remote Pilot, my job is to manage unmanned aerial vehicle flight operations and make sure to practice all the procedures and policies from Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to include standard flight and ground operations. Also, my primary tasks include building flight vehicle structure and related components as a support assistance to the hardware team.

I am a senior, majoring in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I am an engineer for the hardware team. My job is to design and manufacture the manipulator system, especially the Gripper. I make 3D models of the system using AutoCAD, Solidworks and Autodesk Inventor. I have great passion for Manufacturing. I have had three technical internships, related to manufacturing, over my undergraduate course. I plan to graduate in Fall 2020, and work with my family thereafter.
