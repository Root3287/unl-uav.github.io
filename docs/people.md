Unmanned aircraft systems, or drones are no longer toys or hobby, these are now a tool for entry into dozens of lucrative careers. As a Certified Remote Pilot, my job is to manage unmanned aerial vehicle flight operations and make sure to practice all the procedures and policies from Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to include standard flight and ground operations. Also, my primary tasks include building flight vehicle structure and related components as a support assistance to the hardware team.
