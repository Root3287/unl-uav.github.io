# Onboarding

## Activity Requirements
There are a few things that members must complete to be considered a full member on the team. These usually include paying dues, completing safety training, completing lab access agreement form, and engaging in outreach opportunities. Dues are $20 and can be directly paid to the club treasurer, or any one of the team leads. Cash is preferred. Safety training can be completed independently, however, there will be an opportunity to knock out safety training in one sitting. Upon completing safety training, lab access agreement form, and dues, members are granted lab access. This year, due to policies put into effect because of Covid-19, completing the two hours outreach requirements is temporarily not required. Members can and will have the opportunity to participate in outreach events, if desired. This usually entails advertising the Aerospace club at a club fair or volunteering with kids as an aerospace ambassador.

### Lab Safety Trainings
To complete club safety training, visit this website:  [https://ehs.unl.edu/web-based-training](https://ehs.unl.edu/web-based-training)

Once there, you will need to click on the *four* hyperlinks for

1. Core – Injury and Illness Prevention Plan (IIPP)
2. Core – Emergency Preparedness Training
3. General Electrical Safety Awareness
4. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

You will be provided material to read for each one and then a quiz to take after you have read it. Once you pass the quiz, you should receive an email from the site saying that you have done so.

When you receive this email, please forward it to [unl.aerospace.safety.training@gmail.com](mailto:unl.aerospace.safety.training@gmail.com)

## Team Structure
The team is loosely divided into hardware and software. The hardware group is responsible for designing and constructing the drones needed for design decisions. They are responsible for developing the drones’ autonomy, supporting the hardware requirements for the software, and maintaining the telemetry feed. The software group is responsible for developing the on-board computer vision systems that receive commands and transmit parsed images to the operator.

## Competition
IARC Mission 9 has challenged us to build and program a fully autonomous aerial system that is capable of performing tasks in mid-air. Below is a gist of Mission 9 objectives:

- Fly fully autonomous
- Use ONBOARD Computing (no data links except for kill switch and safety pilot override)
- Avoid other aerial robots
- Avoid physical obstacles
- Conduct the mission successfully (replace a communication module and return home) under 9 minutes

## Funding
The UAV team gets its primary funding from two sources: NASA Nebraska and eSAB. NASA Nebraska is the largest source of funding, usually granting us between $6,500 - $8,000 each year. This year the grant award amount is capped at $7000. eSAB funding is reimburse-only, meaning members would need to make the initial purchase and then get reimbursed for the amount later.. We are usually granted between $3,750 - $5,000 from eSAB.

## Travelling
For Mission 9, IARC is hosting the competition at Front Royal, Virginia. The competition is usually a three days event and occurs during the first few weeks of August. To travel, members must have paid their dues, completed safety training, and completed their outreach requirements.
