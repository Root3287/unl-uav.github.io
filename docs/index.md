## Who We Are

There are many important sectors of the aerospace industry, and one of the fastest growing and most hyped is that of the 'drone', or more properly, 'unmanned aerial vehicle' or 'system'- a UAV or UAS. With the beginning of the UAV Team, the Aerospace Club has opened up the possibility of projects which are almost entirely software based, bringing the realms of cutting-edge aerospace development directly to students of Computer Science and Computer and Software Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

## What We Do

The UNL Aerospace UAV IARC Team is comprised into two subteams focused on hardware and software. We aim to accomplish the Mission 9 objectives layed out by AUVSI IARC Mission 9 rules by building an unmanned aerial platform.

## What is AUVSI IARC
![](res/img/iarc_logo.png)

The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), the world's largest nonprofit organization dedicated to the advancement of unmanned systems and robotics, represents corporations and professionals from more than 60 countries involved in industry, government and academia. AUVSI members work in the defense, civil and commercial markets. Visit AUVSI at [www.auvsi.org](https://www.auvsi.org/).

The IARC is the longest running collegiate aerial robotics competition in the world, challenging competing teams to develop robotic aerial systems considered impossible for any robots currently owned by government or industry. The IARC proceeds in a series of 'missions', with teams continuing to attempt a particular mission for multiple years until one team succeeds and a new mission is started. Visit the IARC challenge at [www.aerialroboticscompetition.org](http://www.aerialroboticscompetition.org/).

## Mission 9 Objective
1. Fly fully autonomous
2. Use ONBOARD computing (no data links except for kill switch and safety pilot override)
3. Avoid obstacles including:
a. Other aerial robots
b. Physical obstacles
4. Conduct the mission successfully (replace the module and return home) under 9 minutes
