## Software
[comment]: <> (![](res/img/software_team.jpg))
The software subteam is tasked with developing and integrating systems and technologies to keep the drone in the sky. The team uses technologies including C++, Linux, git, and the Robot Operating System, as well as the MAVLink protocol and Open Computer Vision. The software subteam is comprised of two project teams that work in an agile software development environment. The two project teams, led by experienced project managers, focus on two separate areas: navigation and vision/intelligence. The navigation project team deals with processing the geographical position of the drone, plotting best possible courses, and optimizing drone flight patterns. The vision/intelligence team deals with machine perception and processing video data. The data is compiled and interpreted to present the drone with a best course of action in any scenario.

If you are interested in software engineering, machine perception, computer vision, artificial intelligence, or automata, this is the team for you!

The hardware team is focused on the electromechanical systems used to complete objectives in the competition. We design, construct, and analyze mechanical solutions for our competition all while working with our aerial system. This can include designing and 3D printing parts, creating robotic systems, and adjusting or altering our drone frames. Hardware members can expect lots of hands-on design practice on CAD software like Solidworks. If youâ€™re interested in working with mechanical systems, consider joining the Hardware team!
