For all the software work that goes into a UAV, it can't get off the ground without the necessary mechanical structures and systems for the software to interact with. To this end, our Hardware Group is tasked with designing, producing, and assembling all structural and mechanical components of the aerial system. These components have included everything from custom landing legs and specialty components for completing the competition, to a solution for battery attachment and testing and maintenance on the frame. This requires familiarity with the tools and equipment necessary for effective component production, including power tools, machine tools, and even a 3D printer, as well as computing tools. The computing tools used by the Hardware Group mostly consist of the program Solidworks, to include its 3D CAD design suite, as well as structural and fluid simulation. When simulations require a second opinion, ANSYS is utilized.

## Software
[comment]: <> (![](res/img/software_team.jpg))
For the aerial vehicle to be “unmanned”, or fully autonomous, a big chunk of computer programs have to be written for and implemented to it. This is the task our Software Group is assigned to tackle. The programming language utilized is C++.
