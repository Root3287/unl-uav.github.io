## Software
[comment]: <> (![](res/img/software_team.jpg))
The software subteam is tasked with developing and integrating systems and technologies to keep the drone in the sky. The team uses technologies including C++, Linux, git, and the Robot Operating System, as well as the MAVLink protocol and Open Computer Vision. The software subteam is comprised of two project teams that work in an agile software development environment. The two project teams, led by experienced project managers, focus on two separate areas: navigation and vision/intelligence. The navigation project team deals with processing the geographical position of the drone, plotting best possible courses, and optimizing drone flight patterns. The vision/intelligence team deals with machine perception and processing video data. The data is compiled and interpreted to present the drone with a best course of action in any scenario.

If you are interested in software engineering, machine perception, computer vision, artificial intelligence, or automata, this is the team for you!

## Hardware

For all the software work that goes into a UAV, it can't get off the ground without the necessary mechanical structures and systems for the software to interact with. To this end, our Hardware Group is tasked with designing, producing, and assembling all structural and mechanical components of the aerial system. These components have included everything from custom landing legs and specialty components for completing the competition, to a solution for battery attachment and testing and maintenance on the frame. This requires familiarity with the tools and equipment necessary for effective component production, including power tools, machine tools, and even a 3D printer, as well as computing tools. The computing tools used by the Hardware Group mostly consist of the program SolidWorks, to include its 3D CAD design suite, as well as structural and fluid simulation. When simulations require a second opinion, ANSYS is utilized.
